Y-14M PROTOTYPE DEMO SCRIPT (90 seconds)

"Good morning. I'll demonstrate our Y-14M prototype.

First, I'll upload our credit card portfolio data - about 10 accounts for this demo.
[Click upload, select dummy.csv]

The system validates required fields: monthly income, revolving utilization, and delinquency status.
[Point to data preview]

Now I'll generate the report.
[Click Generate button]

Within seconds, we have three outputs:

1. A clean CSV with calculated balances and data integrity hashes
2. A narrative summary showing $2.1M in outstanding balances, 51% average utilization, and 30% delinquency rate
3. Full Excel workbook for regulatory submission

The system also flags our $100K variance against the general ledger - well within tolerance.

Questions? The built-in Q&A can answer Y-14M requirements from Fed documentation.
[Type: "When are Y-14M reports due?"]

This prototype reduces report prep from 2 days to 2 minutes.

Thank you."
