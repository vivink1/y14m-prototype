Y-14M Reporting Overview

What is Y-14M?
The Y-14M report is a monthly regulatory filing required by the Federal Reserve for large bank holding companies. It captures detailed loan-level data for various credit products including credit cards, auto loans, and mortgages.

Who must file Y-14M?
Bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more must submit Y-14M reports monthly. The reporting threshold is reviewed annually.

What data is required for credit card reporting?
Credit card data must include account identifiers, outstanding balances, credit limits, payment history, delinquency status, and borrower credit scores. All data must be as of the reporting period end date.

When are Y-14M reports due?
Monthly Y-14M reports are due by the 30th calendar day following the reporting period end date. Extensions may be granted for extraordinary circumstances.

What is revolving utilization?
Revolving utilization is the ratio of outstanding balance to credit limit. It is a key indicator of credit risk and borrower behavior. Higher utilization generally indicates higher risk.

How should delinquency be reported?
Delinquency should be reported in buckets: current, 30-59 days past due, 60-89 days past due, and 90+ days past due. The DPD (days past due) count begins the day after the payment due date.
